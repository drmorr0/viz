This software is under active development.  Expecting backwards 
compatibility, or relying on any specific feature that may or may not
exist in the current version you are using is a little crazy.  I am 
attempting to keep this README file up-to-date with relevent information
and requirements, but I'm certainly not making any promises about that.
If you have questions, or something doesn't seem to be working the way
you think it should, the best thing to do is send me a note.

Requirements
------------
 * cmake (for generating the build process)
 * gtkmm-3.0 (and all dev files)
 * cairomm-3.0 (and all dev files)
 * JSON spirit (available at
        http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented)
 * The most recent version of graph-lib (available at 
        https://github.com/drmorr0/graph-lib)
 * pkg-config

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
This project relies on features, algorithms, and templates from the
C++11 standard.  If you experience compilation errors, it may be because
your compiler does not fully support C++11 yet.  I am using clang
version 3.3 to compile this code and libstdc++-4.8.1 for the STL; I have
also had success compiling with g++-4.8.1.  Other compilers may or may
not work.

To compile this source code on Linux:

0) Edit the CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory:
    - Change the location of the GRAPHLIB_DIR variable on line 57
      to match the location in which you have installed it (if you
      are running the debug version of this code, you will need to
      install the debug version of graphlib as well).
1) Enter the build directory
2) Type 'cmake ..', and then type 'make'

    If you want to build a debug version of this code, you will need 
    to run cmake with the following option: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug

To compile this source code under Windows:

  You're on your own right now.  I'm hoping to eventually support 
  Windows, and I'm trying to avoid making any platform-specific code, 
  but my bigger priority at present is to get cool features implemented.

Running Instructions
--------------------
There are sample input files contained in the 'inputs' subdirectory.  
For example, try running
    viz input/test.json

Viz has two different modes of input, mouse input and command-prompt
input.  Left-clicking anywhere on the canvas will drag the canvas.
Left-click and drag to move nodes of the graph, or shift+left-click to
drag the subtree rooted at a node.  The mouse wheel will zoom in and
out.  You can click on a node without dragging to get specific
information about that node.

The command prompt understands a number of different commands.  Type
'help' to see a list of supported commands, and type 'help <command>' 
to learn more information about a specific command.

Try typing the following in the program's command prompt for the example
graph:
    hide Contour <= 7
    format Contour == 3 blue

Here are some neat tricks:
    hide Pruned >= 0; since nodes only get a "Pruned" property if they
        have no children, this is a quick way to get rid of a lot of
        extra "uninteresting" nodes in the tree
