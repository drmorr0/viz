Welcome to Viz! The visualization software.

This software copyright (c) David R. Morrison, 2014.  
See the accompanying LICENSE file for details.

This software is under active development.  Expecting backwards 
compatibility, or relying on any specific feature that may or may not
exist in the current version you are using is a little crazy.  I am 
attempting to keep this README file up-to-date with relevent information
and requirements, but I'm certainly not making any promises about that.
If you have questions, or something doesn't seem to be working the way
you think it should, the best thing to do is send me a note.

Requirements
------------
 * cmake (for generating the build process)
 * gtkmm-3.0 (and all dev files)
 * cairomm-3.0 (and all dev files)
 * JSON spirit (available at
		http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented)
 * The most recent version of graph-lib (available at 
		https://github.com/drmorr0/graph-lib)

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
To compile this source code on Linux:

1) Enter the build directory
2) Type 'cmake ..', and then type 'make'
	* If you want to build a debug version of this code, you will need 
	  to run cmake with the following option: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug

To compile this source code under Windows:

  You're on your own right now.  I'm hoping to eventually support 
  Windows, and I'm trying to avoid making any platform-specific code, 
  but my bigger priority at present is to get cool features implemented.

Running Instructions
--------------------
There are sample input files contained in the 'inputs' subdirectory.  
For example, try running
	viz input/test.json

Then try typing the following in the program's command prompt:
	filter Contour <= 7
	format Contour == 3 blue
